# Simple Discord Client

For use with [my simple Discord server](https://github.com/yo-wotop/simple-discord-server).

## Installation

First, get the repository and install the requirements: 

```
git clone https://github.com/yo-wotop/simple-discord-client.git
cd simple-discord-client
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Realistically, you only need `requests` for requirements.

## Use

**OPTIONALLY** fill out the `discord_info.json` file, as it lets you easily access your guilds, channels, and users dynamically. 

Review `sample.py` to get a feel for how it works.
